00:00:00.359 --> 00:00:04.480
hello I'm Carter and today I'm going to

00:00:02.560 --> 00:00:07.480
be talking about

00:00:04.480 --> 00:00:09.360
octopuses uh did you know that octopuses

00:00:07.480 --> 00:00:13.280
actually have three hearts instead of

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:16.440
one heart and the reason why they have

00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:18.880
three hearts so they actually use two

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:22.119
their hearts to breathe through their

00:00:18.880 --> 00:00:24.560
gills so they're able to swim underwater

00:00:22.119 --> 00:00:27.080
and be underwater for so such long

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:29.519
periods then their other heart is

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:31.160
actually what actually runs their body

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:33.879
just kind of like our bodies our heart

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:37.600
runs our body same thing with that third

00:00:33.879 --> 00:00:41.079
heart that they have and O octopus is

00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:44.399
also actually have blue blood um making

00:00:41.079 --> 00:00:47.600
them more like adaptable in water when

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:51.239
it's colder and stuff like that and

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:54.399
then another cool fact about octopuses

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:58.000
so they're they can actually stop their

00:00:54.399 --> 00:00:59.199
heart um making them consume less energy

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:01.120
that's why you always see them kind of

00:00:59.199 --> 00:01:03.199
on the bottom of the water like

00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:06.560
shuffling along cuz they're actually not

00:01:03.199 --> 00:01:09.159
using all of their hearts they shut them

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:11.040
down so that they can kind of conserve

00:01:09.159 --> 00:01:14.080
energy and not have to like eat as much

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:15.520
food and stuff like that but interesting

00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:18.200
fact about octopus is thanks for

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:18.200
listening
